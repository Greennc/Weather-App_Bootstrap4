# Weather-App_Bootstrap4
Weather app made with JavaScript and styled with Bootstrap 4


I used HTML5 and Javascript to create this app.  It enabled me to have the background change when the weather did.  I styled it with Bootstrap 4
to make it more reponsive for the mobile web.  

I want to add location based services to it soon so that people can get the information more quickly with location based services.
